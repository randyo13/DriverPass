# DriverPass

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project is DriverPass, who is represented by Liam (the owner) and Ian (the IT officer). They wanted me to design a system that provided driver training through an integrated platform athat includes online practice exams, road training, and DMV compliance. The main functions were to access online practice tests and classes, schedule and track driving lessons, user activity tracking and reporting, using a secure and scalable cloud-based architecture, and have different user roles with specific permissions. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did a good job collecting the details for the client requirements and ensure I had a clear understanding of what DriverPass needed. I also believe I did a good job having the design focused on the user roles and the specific needs neccessary. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would focus on enhancing the user interface (UI) design section in the Business Requirements document. While my current design includes basic functionalities, it lacks detailed screen layouts and user flow diagrams, which are essential for ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. To improve this, I would develop comprehensive layouts for each user type, illustrating the arrangement and interface elements for various screens, such as the user dashboard, scheduling page, and progress tracking. This would provide a clear visual representation of the system's look and feel.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs were gathered through detailed conversations with the client on the DriverPass transcript, actively focusing on their desired outcomes. Key user roles were identified, including administrators, instructors, and students, each with distinct needs. For instance, administrators required full access to manage accounts and reset passwords, while students needed a simple interface for scheduling lessons and accessing practice tests. These insights were implemented into the system design by ensuring that each user role had tailored functionalities. Administrators are given comprehensive control over system settings, instructors have access to scheduling and student progress tracking, and students enjoy an intuitive interface for managing their training sessions and accessing study materials. The system was desired to be cloud-based for scalability and included robust security measures to protect user data. Considering the user’s needs is crucial when designing a system because it directly impacts usability and satisfaction. It also ensures that the final product is not only functional but also intuitive and user-friendly, leading to a positive user experience and higher client satisfaction.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching software design, I employ a systematic approach that begins with thorough requirements gathering through stakeholder interviews and analysis of user needs. This step is crucial for understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Following this, I focus on creating clear and detailed architectural designs, utilizing techniques like use case modeling, domain modeling, and behavioral modeling to map out system interactions and components effectively. I'll emphasize modularity and scalability in architecture to accommodate future enhancements and changes. Throughout the design process, continuous validation with stakeholders ensures alignment with business goals and user expectations. By integrating agile practices for iterative development and rigorous testing, I ensure robustness and usability in the final product.
